# Overview
The run_analysis.R file was created for the Coursera course Getting and Cleaning Data class. The codebook has full details on data source and variables used. 

#Description of Analysis
The run_analysis.R script does the following:
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

#Important Notes
Note that the R script assumes that you have the UCI HAR Dataset (as indicated in the codebook) in your working directory in R.
